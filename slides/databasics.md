# Data and Information

## What is Data?

![](img/data_spiner.jpg)

. . .

Individual observations made in a specific context.

## Data is something that people *make*.

## What is Information?

. . .

In our context, information is generated by analyzing data.

# What is a Database?

## A shared and stored collection of related data.

How else might you store data?

## What are databases *for* ?

## The 4 Characteristics of Databases

1. A database represents data (not information).
2. A database is built for a purpose.
3. A database is logical and internally consistent.
4. A database is queryable.

# The Relational Model

## Edgar Codd

"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks," IBM Research Lab, 1970

## Preserving the connections between data *independently* and *consistently*

Relational databases don't depend on the way users will interface with the data, and all of the data can be easily referenced.

## An example relational table

## Criteria for Relational Tables

1. Rows contain data about an *entity*.
2. Columns contain data about an entity's *attributes*.
3. Fields  contain a non-empty atomic data value.
4. Attributes conform to a specific format.
5. Each column has a unique name.
6. The order of rows and columns may not affect the relation.
7. Each record must be unique, such that a set of attributes identify each entity.

## Is this a relational table?

# Dependencies

## How do tables relate to one another?

"A *functional dependency* is a relationship between two sets of attributes in a database, where one set (the determinant) determines the values of the other set (the dependent)."

[monday.com](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/functional-dependencies-2/)

## Types of functional dependencies

- *full functional dependency*: one and only one value of the determinant attribute determines one and only one value of the dependent attribute
- *partial functional dependency*: a dependency that exists between a subset of the (composite) primary key and one or more dependent attributes
- *transitive functional dependency*: a dependency that exists between two or more non-key attributes

## Dependencies can help identify and reduce **data redundancy**.

## Dependencies are defined by *keys*.

- Candidate Key: any attribute or set of attributes which uniquely identify each entity
- **Primary Key**: the developer-chosen candidate key.
- Secondary Key: any non-primary candidate key; typically used as an index.
- **Foreign Key**: a primary key from an external relation.
- Composite Key: any key comprised of more than one attribute.

## Dependency Diagrams

## How to Draw a Dependency Diagram

1. Identify the primary key (or composite key).
2. Draw arrows from the primary key(s) to all other attributes.
3. If there is a composite key, look for *partial dependencies* between part of the key and any other attributes.
4. Look for *transitive dependencies* between any non-key attributes.

## You can turn the diagram into notation of the functional dependencies.

(Building, Number) → (nBed, nBath)  
(Building) → (StreetAddress)

This follows the form:

*Determinants* → *Dependents*

## These functional dependencies will become two tables.

BUILDING(**Building**, StreetAddress)  
APARTMENT(*Building*, **Number**, nBed, nBath)

This is a *schema*, and it follows the form:

TABLE(**PrimaryKey**, *ForeignKey*, Attribute)


## List all of the functional dependencies.

Month|Day|Year|Item|Price|Quantity
--|--|--|---|--|--
8|11|2023|Apple|$3.99|2
8|14|2023|CokeZero|$4.99|3
8|14|2023|Apple|$3.99|5

Which column or set of columns might form the primary key of this table?

# Normalization

## **Normalization** organizes data based on functional dependencies in order to remove potential redundancies.

## Three Stages of Normalization

- *First Normal Form (1NF)*: follows all criteria of Codd's Relational Model, with primary key identified
- *Second Normal Form (2NF)*: all partial dependencies removed
- *Third Normal Form (3NF)*: all transitive dependencies removed
- There are more that typically aren't used!

## Making a dependency diagram prepares you to normalize!

## You don't always want to fully normalize your data.

Some data (like dates) are better kept together for ease of use and performance reasons, even if that means the database doesn't follow every normal form. Returning the database to this state is called **denormalization**.

# Let's Practice Normalization!

## Follow these steps:

1. Rewrite the table so it's in **1NF** (i.e. so it follows Codd's relational model).
2. Draw the *dependency diagram* and identify the primary key(s).
3. If necessary, redraw the *dependency diagram* so it's in **2NF**. Create the accompanying *schema*.
4. If necessary, redraw the *dependency diagram* so it's in **3NF**. Create the accompanying *schema*.

## We'll try this one together.

# Data Integrity

## Data integrity "refers to the **accuracy and consistency** (validity) of data over its life cycle."

[cf. Digital Guardian article](https://www.digitalguardian.com/blog/what-data-integrity-data-protection-101)

## ALCOA: Data should be *attributable*, *legible*, *contemporaneous*, *original*, and *accurate*.

##  Types of Data Integrity

- *Entity integrity*: primary keys represent one and only one entity
- *Referential integrity*: foreign keys define connections between tables
- *Domain integrity*: values in a database follow a set format
- *User-defined integrity*: users can define new data and its constraints
