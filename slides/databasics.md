# Data and Information

## What is Data?

![](img/data_spiner.jpg)

. . .

Individual observations made in a specific context.

## Data is something that people *make*.

## What is Information?

. . .

In our context, information is generated by analyzing data.

# What is a Database?

## A shared and stored collection of related data.

How else might you store data?

## What are databases *for* ?

## The 4 Characteristics of Databases

1. A database represents data (not information).
2. A database is built for a purpose.
3. A database is logical and internally consistent.
4. A database is queryable.

# The Relational Model

"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks," IBM Research Lab, 1970

## Preserving the connections between data *independently* and *consistently*

Relational databases don't depend on the way users will interface with the data, and all of the data can be easily referenced.

## An example relational table

## Criteria for Relational Tables

1. Rows contain data about an *entity*.
2. Columns contain data about an entity's *attributes*.
3. Fields  contain a non-empty atomic data value.
4. Attributes conform to a specific format.
5. Each column has a unique name.
6. The order of rows and columns may not affect the relation.
7. Each record must be unique, such that a set of attributes identify each entity.

## Is this a relational table?

# Dependencies

## How do tables relate to one another?

"A *functional dependency* is a relationship between two sets of attributes in a database, where one set (the determinant) determines the values of the other set (the dependent)."

[monday.com](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/functional-dependencies-2/)

## Types of functional dependencies

- full functional dependency
- partial functional dependency
- transitive functional dependency

## Dependencies can help identify and reduce **data redundancy**.

## Dependency Diagrams

![](img/dependency.png)

## You can turn the diagram into notation of the functional dependencies.

(Building, Number) → (nBed, nBath)  
(Building) → (StreetAddress)

This follows the form:

*Determinants* → *Dependents*

## These functional dependencies will become two tables.

BUILDING(**Building**, StreetAddress)  
APARTMENT(*Building*, **Number**, nBed, nBath)

This is a *schema*, and it follows the form:

TABLE(**PrimaryKey**, *ForeignKey*, Attribute)

## Dependencies are defined by *keys*.

- Candidate Key: any attribute or set of attributes which uniquely identify each entity
- **Primary Key**: the developer-chosen candidate key.
- Secondary Key: any non-primary candidate key; typically used as an index.
- **Foreign Key**: a primary key from an external relation.
- Composite Key: any key comprised of more than one attribute.

## List all of the functional dependencies.

Month|Day|Year|Item|Price|Quantity
--|--|--|---|--|--
8|11|2023|Apple|$3.99|2
8|14|2023|CokeZero|$4.99|3
8|14|2023|Apple|$3.99|2

Which column or set of columns might form the primary key of this table?
