## Preserving the connections between data *independently* and *consistently*

Relational databases don't depend on the way users will interface with the data, and all of the data can be easily referenced.

## An example relational table

## Criteria for Relational Tables

1. Rows contain data about an *entity*.
2. Columns contain data about an entity's *attributes*.
3. Fields  contain a non-empty atomic data value.
4. Attributes conform to a specific format.
5. Each column has a unique name.
6. The order of rows and columns may not affect the relation.
7. Each record must be unique, such that a set of attributes identify each entity.
