**Complete by: the end of the day Tuesday if you are the lead-off poster, the end of the day Wednesday if you are responding**

The purpose of the annotation assignment is to bring current examples of information technology in society into context with the discussions we are having about course material. In this way, we can see connections between historical developments and today’s innovations. It is also one of the ways we will practice writing about technology in this class.

We'll use [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) as our annotation tool for the class. (I'll guide you through the process of creating a Hypothesis account and joining the group for our course.)

Once a week, one or more of you will find a relevant article online and write a short paragraph, as a Hypothesis annotation, in which you summarize the article and explain why you think it’s important. The original writer should add this paragraph as annotation to the article title, and should include (integrate) a quote from the article as part of the paragraph. This annotation should be made in our Hypothesis group for the course (link on Sakai, and remember that you can select the group using the dropdown at the top of the annotation window---don't just post to Public). You should also pose a question or two for other students in the class to respond to. You should complete your post by the end of the day on Tuesday of your assigned week, by midnight.

Everyone else in the class should read the posted article(s) and write an annotation for each one---you'll find a link to the article on the Hypothesis page for our group (link on Sakai). You should highlight and respond to a specific quote in the text, responding to one of the questions or introducting a new aspect of the topic that you are interested in. You should complete your annotation by the end of the following day, Wednesday.

Initial annotations will likely be 6-8 or more sentences; subsequent responses/annotations should have **at least 4 complete sentences and an idea that stands on its own**.

*Keep in mind:* Don't just say "Yes, I agree with your idea." Expand or elaborate on what others have written with your own original thoughts!

In all your posts, I want to see **a clear response to a highlighted passage from the article**. This will help us practice one of the most important aspects of writing: integrating and responding to sources.

**Requirements**:

- See [Sakai](https://sakai.washjeff.edu) for your assigned day
- One paragraph (at least four sentences) every week
- A clear response to a highlighted sentence or passage from the article
